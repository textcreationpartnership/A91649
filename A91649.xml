            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ies.</speaker>
               <p>It seemes very strange to me that your Grave and unlimited power could not discountenance and quell the hairebraine multitude, whose igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance▪ and fury rather led them on, then Religion.</p>

               <p>We were no may defective in the procecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of our Authority and Iustice, this age can give sufficient testimony of our severe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, dwee spare no profession whom wee found
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125449:3"/> to be cōtumatious: many Ministers we did suspend, whose obstinacy withstood our holy cōmands, others who were not admitted into Ecclesiasticall orders, we did according to the severity of the Lawes provided in that case, punish, &amp; had I beleeve in a very short space obtain'd our desires, but that we were prevented by a Session of Parliament. For all those whom favour nor promotion could not perswade; although against their consciences, to admit our ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were as so many introductions, to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Catholique Religion in this land, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd some by whipping and scourging, others by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring and strict imprisonment, to give their consent, and receive our Authority. Excommunications were our Recreations, thousands wee excluded by our decrees from the bosome of the Church, and where we found a zealott obstinate in his opinion, wee commanded him to a close imprisonment, and having the strength of the Law at our Command, we sentenced, as wee thought most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our purposes.</p>

               <p>The faction I last mentioned to you, have rent and torne our Lawne sleeves, and so beslubber'd our Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall whitenesse, that we have small or no hopes to recover. Or the Sempstresses in the <hi>Strand,</hi> or <hi>Westminster</hi> cannot mend the Rent we have received, nor all the Landresses about the Citie scoure or clense us from the greevous blott and aspersion which is cast upon us. The strict or of professiors, have so prevailed ouer us, that now we are but shadowes of the Authority wee had, and those privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges we enioyed, of enioyning Pennance and excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb facs="tcp:125449:4"/> is taken from us. Many of our Lawne society are so Questioned in this Parliament, that they are in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy of their lives and fortunes. The Wrens nest is found to be so defiled, that it is beleived he must leave his liberty and betake himself to a Cage. And <hi>Canterbury</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, the Metropolitan and First Patron in this cause, now wants a Patron to countenance him: Hee that so lately so powerfully laboured to promote this cause, is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the Tower himselfe.</p>

               <p>The Surplesse is, like our power, scorn'd and slighted, disrespected generally, and termed by our nice Puritanes, the smocke of the whore of Rome. The Organs are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be put to as much silence as his Grace of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and some other of his Episcopall fraternity put many Ministers. And the Altar by whose steppes wee did hope to ascend to the top of our of ambition, is taken away and demolished and no more signe of it left, then will bee of our Power and Authority.</p>
